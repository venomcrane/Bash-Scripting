# Bash Scripting Collection

This repository contains several Bash scripts for task automation, computer security and system administration. It is a constantly evolving collection where I add new tools and optimizations.

> All of these scripts is for my own personal use and practice as well as for and educational purposes

## ðŸ‘¾ Offensive Scripts 
| Script | Decription |
|--------|------------|
| `scan_ports.sh` | Scan open ports on a host |
| `hostScan.sh` | Scan hosts in a given Network  |
| `permissions.sh`| Reads LInux permissions |

> The rest of the scripts are for practice. 


## ðŸš€ How to use / execute
To run a script, make sure it has execute permissions:
```bash
chmod +x script.sh 
./script.sh #execute the script 
```
